# CoopFlow_paddle
Cooperative learning of Langevin Flow (short-run MCMC) and Normalizing Flow

This repository contains a paddle-paddle implementation for the CoopFlow algorithm proposed in the ICLR 2022 paper "[A Tale of Two Flows: Cooperative Learning of Langevin Flow and Normalizing Flow Toward Energy-Based Model](https://openreview.net/forum?id=31d5RLCUuXC&referrer=%5BAuthor%20Console%5D(%2Fgroup%3Fid%3DICLR.cc%2F2022%2FConference%2FAuthors%23your-submissions))"

## Set Up Environment
Please install the following packages:

python = 3.6
paddlepaddle-gpu = 2.2.2
matplotlib = 3.2.2

For the installation of paddle, please check "[this website](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/install/quick?docurl=/documentation/docs/zh/install/conda/windows-conda.html)".

## train to model
We put our pretrained checkpoints "[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sRat_DQr4uWVC2OkqudKo6z5BsOJf3hT?usp=sharing)".
1. To train the CoopFlow model on cifar10:
```bash
python main.py --train True --resume False
```

2. To train the CoopFlow(pre) model on cifar10:
```bash
python main.py --train True --resume False --load_pretrain_flow True
```
Note that to train CoopFlow model, you should first have a pretrained flow model. We provide the pretrained checkpoint here  "[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sRat_DQr4uWVC2OkqudKo6z5BsOJf3hT?usp=sharing)". Or you can train the checkpoint you self using the code main_flow.py. Simply run the following code. 
```bash
python main_flow.py
```
It will create ./pretrain_flow folder and save the checkpoint under directory ./pretrain_flow/save_flow. Please copy the generated checkpoint into ./flow_ckpt directory so that the CoopFlow code can find it.

#### for debug use only
Currently what I put here is the results of a small EBM model; to run the large EBM model (which is the one we used in pytorch), please comment line 16 in main.py and uncomment line 17 in main.py. (You can check the structure difference under models/ebm/ebm.py). Large (deeper) EBM is more prune to blow up and this usually happens at the first training epoch.
