# CoopFlow_paddle
Cooperative learning of Langevin Flow (short-run MCMC) and Normalizing Flow

This repository contains a paddle-paddle implementation for the CoopFlow algorithm proposed in the ICLR 2022 paper "[A Tale of Two Flows: Cooperative Learning of Langevin Flow and Normalizing Flow Toward Energy-Based Model](https://openreview.net/forum?id=31d5RLCUuXC&referrer=%5BAuthor%20Console%5D(%2Fgroup%3Fid%3DICLR.cc%2F2022%2FConference%2FAuthors%23your-submissions))"

## Set Up Environment
Please install the following packages:

python = 3.6
paddlepaddle-gpu = 2.2.2
matplotlib = 3.2.2

For the installation of paddle, please check "[this website](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/install/quick?docurl=/documentation/docs/zh/install/conda/windows-conda.html)".
